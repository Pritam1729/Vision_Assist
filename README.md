# Vision_Assist

Vision_Assist is a deep learning-based application designed to assist visually impaired individuals by generating descriptive captions for indoor environments. The project aims to provide meaningful insights about the surroundings using video data and natural language descriptions, enhancing accessibility and independence.

## Features

- **Video Input Processing**: Extracts meaningful features from videos using LSTM and attention mechanisms.
- **Self-Attention Mechanism**: Enhances feature extraction by focusing on important parts of the video data.
- **Multi-Head Attention in Decoder**: Improves caption generation by aligning video features with language representations.
- **Customizable Architecture**: Supports variable caption lengths, vocabulary sizes, and adjustable model parameters.
- **Layer Normalization**: Ensures stable training and improved convergence.
- **Real-Time Captioning**: Capable of generating descriptions in real-time for practical use cases.

## How It Works

1. **Encoder**:
   - Processes video frames into feature vectors using LSTM layers.
   - Applies a self-attention mechanism to highlight relevant features.
   - Outputs a context-rich representation of the video data.

2. **Decoder**:
   - Uses embeddings to process caption inputs.
   - Integrates video features and captions through multi-head attention.
   - Generates descriptive captions word by word.

3. **Integration**:
   - Combines encoder and decoder outputs to produce meaningful and accurate descriptions of indoor environments.
